# TRANSCORCODILE

## Major Modules:

### ✅Framework as Backend:
In this major module, you are required to utilize a specific web framework for your
backend development, and that framework is Django.

### ✅Multiple players:
It is possible to have more than two players. Each player needs a live control (so
the previous “Distant players” module is highly recommanded). It’s up to you to
define how the game could be played with 3, 4, 5, 6 ... players. Along with the
regular 2 players game, you can choose a single number of players, greater than
2, for this multiplayer module. Ex: 4 players can play on a squarred board, each
player owns one unique side of the square.

### ✅Introduce an AI Opponent:
In this major module, the objective is to incorporate an AI player into the game.
Notably, the use of the A* algorithm is not permitted for this task. Key features
and goals include:
◦ Develop an AI opponent that provides a challenging and engaging gameplay
experience for users.
◦ The AI must replicate human behavior, meaning that in your AI implementation, you must simulate keyboard input. The constraint here is that the AI
can only refresh its view of the game once per second, requiring it to anticipate
bounces and other actions.
◦ Implement AI logic and decision-making processes that enable the AI player
to make intelligent and strategic moves.
◦ Explore alternative algorithms and techniques to create an effective AI player
without relying on A*.
◦ Ensure that the AI adapts to different gameplay scenarios and user interactions.
This major module aims to enhance the game by introducing an AI opponent that
adds excitement and competitiveness without relying on the A* algorithm.

### ✅Implementing Advanced 3D Techniques:
This major module, known as "Graphics," is focused on enhancing the visual aspects
of the Pong game. It introduces the utilization of advanced 3D techniques to create
a more immersive gaming experience. Specifically, the Pong game will be developed
using ThreeJS/WebGL to achieve the desired visual effects.
◦ Advanced 3D Graphics: The primary goal of this module is to implement
advanced 3D graphics techniques to elevate the visual quality of the Pong
game. By utilizing ThreeJS/WebGL , we aim to create stunning visual effects
that immerse players in the gaming environment.
◦ Immersive Gameplay: The incorporation of advanced 3D techniques enhances
the overall gameplay experience by providing users with a visually engaging
and captivating Pong game.
◦ Technology Integration: The chosen technology for this module is ThreeJS/WebGL .
These tools will be used to create the 3D graphics, ensuring compatibility and
optimal performance.
This major module aims to revolutionize the Pong game’s visual elements by introducing advanced 3D techniques. Through the utilization of TreeJS/WebGL , we
aspire to provide players with an immersive and visually stunning gaming experience.

## Minor Modules:

### ✅Use a front-end framework or toolkit:
Your frontend development will utilize the Bootstrap toolkit.

### ✅Use a database for the backend -and more:
The designated database for all DB instances in your project is PostgreSQL .
This choice guarantees data consistency and compatibility across all project components and may be a prerequisite for other modules, such as the backend Framework module.

### ✅Minor module: Support on all devices.
In this module, the main focus is to ensure that your website works seamlessly on
all types of devices. Key features and objectives include:
◦ Make sure the website is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktops, laptops, tablets,
and smartphones.
◦ Ensure that users can easily navigate and interact with the website using
different input methods, such as touchscreens, keyboards, and mice, depending
on the device they are using.
This module aims to provide a consistent and user-friendly experience on all devices,
maximizing accessibility and user satisfaction

### ✅Minor module: Multiple language supports.
In this minor module, the objective is to ensure that your website supports multiple
languages to cater to a diverse user base. Key features and goals include:
◦ Implement support for a minimum of three languages on the website to accommodate a broad audience.
◦ Provide a language switcher or selector that allows users to easily change the
website’s language based on their preferences.
◦ Translate essential website content, such as navigation menus, headings, and
key information, into the supported languages.
◦ Ensure that users can navigate and interact with the website seamlessly, regardless of the selected language.
◦ Consider using language packs or localization libraries to simplify the translation process and maintain consistency across different languages.
◦ Allow users to set their preferred language as a default choice for subsequent
visits to the website.
This minor module aims to enhance the accessibility and inclusivity of your website
by offering content in multiple languages, making it more user-friendly for a diverse
international audience.

### ✅Server-side Rendering (SSR) Integration:
In this minor module, the focus is on integrating Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
to enhance the performance and user experience of your website. Key objectives
include:
◦ Implement SSR to improve the website’s loading speed and overall performance.
◦ Ensure that content is pre-rendered on the server and delivered to users’
browsers for faster initial page loads.
◦ Optimize SEO by providing search engines with pre-rendered HTML content.
◦ Maintain a consistent user experience while benefiting from the advantages of
SSR.
This module aims to boost website performance and SEO by integrating Server-Side
Rendering for faster page loads and improved user experience.

### ✅Expanding Browser Compatibility:
In this minor module, the objective is to enhance the compatibility of the web
application by adding support for an additional web browser. Key features and
objectives include:
◦ Extend browser support to include an additional web browser, ensuring that
users can access and use the application seamlessly.
◦ Conduct thorough testing and optimization to ensure that the web application
functions correctly and displays correctly in the newly supported browser.
◦ Address any compatibility issues or rendering discrepancies that may arise in
the added web browser.
◦ Ensure a consistent user experience across all supported browsers, maintaining
usability and functionality.
This minor module aims to broaden the accessibility of the web application by
supporting an additional web browser, providing users with more choices for their
browsing experience.
